# pandas-challenge

This assignment posed lots of challenges for me at first since I didn't entirely understand how groupby() worked after just lecturing. However, after much googling 
and some help from my peers I became fully capable of understanding what each piece of the function does and it proved to be very useful for this assignment.
You can see that some of the earlier problems in this assignment started off with simpler and longer code. However, by the final direction of this assignemnt
I figured out how powerful using the aggregate to find sum, count, and mean all at the same time instead of 3 separate variables. This is an assignment I think
I will see myself coming back to in the future to look back on as I spent a lot of time on understanding each function and how binning works. Although the final
product doesn't show it I went back to each of the earlier directions to simplify my code with my newly found knowlede after the last direction and I will take this 
learning experience with me for the rest of my career.
